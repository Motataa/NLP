## SUMMARY :

  As mentioned in the reflection page of the details of knowledge and experience about the course and NLP. NLP (natural language processing) is a useful tool that has been used throughout the course. Wherever thereâ€™s a hindrance for technology to understand and perhaps generate the human language, NLP can be very useful. NLP has two components NLU (natural language understanding) and NLG (natural language generation). It's process is more focused on the machine learning and deep learning. NLP techniques have contributed massively to technology like chatbots, which was one of our main projects. To this day these technologies are trending. A lot more can be done or developed and that is what interests me. I hope to contribute to what is already there or perhaps develop something unique. Uniqueness is important in this popular field but as said there is still room for more improvements.
